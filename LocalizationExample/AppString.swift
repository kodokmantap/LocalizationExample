/// # AppString
/// We will use this to fill out strings to show in ``CalculationView``.
///
/// ## Overview
///  This class will be used as a "bridge" between ``CalculationView`` and `Localizable.strings`. This will help the localization within the app. Please check `Localizatble` String File to see the full writings.
